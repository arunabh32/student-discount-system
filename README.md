Student Discount System (JavaFX)

A simple JavaFX application that records student information and calculates discounted course prices based on whether the student is part-time or full-time.

This project demonstrates:

JavaFX UI with forms, tables, and input validation

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance

Use of ObservableList and TableView for dynamic data management

🚀 Features

Add student details (Name, Roll No, Subject, Stream, Status, Course Price)

Status options: Full-Time / Part-Time

Automatic calculation of discounted price:

Part-Time → 40% discount

Full-Time → 30% discount

Displays all students in a JavaFX TableView
